#### • Data Abstraction & Management: 
Expert in clinical and administrative data abstraction from Canadian EMRs (e.g., Nightingale, TELUS PS Suite), ensuring high data quality and integrity.
• Participant Recruitment & Informed Consent: Managed participant recruitment, consent processes, and patient data using tools such as REDCap, ensuring compliance with ethical standards.

### Research Dissemination & Writing:
#### • Manuscripts & Presentations: 
Skilled in drafting and formatting academic manuscripts, project reports, and abstracts for both local and international conferences.
#### • Journal Editorial Experience: 
Assistant editor for two internationally indexed health journals, with 3+ years of experience.
